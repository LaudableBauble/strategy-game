Source Images
	Main tab and you switch image through the panel. Each image has an identifier so tiles from different source images work at the same time.

Randomized Map
	Selected tiles from wherever (let the user select where from?) gets randomized into a new map, adhering to the tile rules in the process.

TileTest
	A selected tile will be put in the middle of a 3x3 square, thus having a tile on each side of it. Makes creating rules for it simpler.


TileRules
	Basic rules that either allow or disallow a tile to neighbor another in a specific direction.

Selection
	Tiles can be selected (works independently from SelectionGroups).
	A panel lets the user assign stuff to the selected tiles.

SelectionGroups
	Selected tiles will be put into groups, which then can be worked with in different ways. (By color?)
	The SelectionGroups can then be mapped to specific attributes/actions.

TileData
	Each tile can have a number of attributes mapped to it, such as terrain type etc.


TileHandler
